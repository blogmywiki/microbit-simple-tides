## What is it?
A toy to give a rough guide to whether tides in your location are rising or falling and very roughly how long it will be until the tide turns. It used a very simple algorithm and assumes there is awlays a 6 hour 12.5 minute between a low tide and the next high tide. 

##Â How do you set it up?
Edit the code 

## Next steps
- Add estimate of how long until next tide changes
- Add other ways of setting the tide time, perhaps by radio (the LED display is disabled with this accessory).
